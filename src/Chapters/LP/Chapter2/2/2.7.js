        <h1>2.7 Equivalences</h1>
        <p>
            A proposition of the form φ if and only if ψ is called an equivalence or double
            implication. Such a proposition, as a whole, is true if φ and ψ have the same
            truth value (both false or both true).
            For example, when I am writing this text, It is raining if and only if it is
            snowing is true. Why? Because both of the propositions It is raining and It
            is snowing are false.

        <p><b>Exercise 8.</b> What is the truth value of the proposition The number 7 is odd
            if and only if 7 is a prime.?</p>
        <br/>

        <p>
            Equivalences are, semantically speaking, conjunctions of two implications:
            φ if and only if ψ gives the same information as
            φ if ψ
            ︸ ︷︷ ︸
            the reverse implication
            and φ only if ψ
            ︸ ︷︷ ︸
            the direct implication
            .
            The proposition φ if ψ is the same as if ψ, then φ (but it has a different
            topic). The proposition φ only if ψ has the same meaning as if φ, then ψ, as
            we dicussed in the previous section on implications.
