        <h1>2.1 Propositions</h1>
        <p>
        A <i>proposition</i> is a statement that is either true or false. Propositions are
        sometimes called <i>sentences</i>. Here are examples of propositions:
        </p>
        <br/>

        <ol>
            <li><i> I wear a blue shirt.</i></li>
            <li><i> You own a laptop computer and a tablet computer, but no smartphone.</i></li>
            <li> 2 + 2 = 4. (<i>Two plus two is four.</i>)</li>
            <li> 1 + 1 = 1 (<i>One plus one is one.</i>)</li>
            <li> 1 + 1 <span>&#8800;</span> 1. (<i>One plus one is not one.</i>)</li>
            <li> <i> If</i> 1 + 1 = 1, <i>then Iâ€™m a banana</i>.</li>
            <li> <i> All natural numbers are integers.</i></li>
            <li> <i> All rational numbers are integers.</i></li>
        </ol>
        <br/>

        <p>Here are examples of things that are not propositions:</p>
        <br/>

        <ol>
            <li> <i> Red and Black</i> (not a statement);</li>
            <li> <span> &#8508;</span> (not a statement);</li>
            <li> <i> Is it raining?</i> (question, not a statement);</li>
            <li> <i> Go fish!</i> (imperative);</li>
            <li> <i> x is greater than 7</i> (we have here a <i>predicate</i> of x; once we set a value
                    for x, the predicate becomes a proposition);</li>
            <li> <i> This sentence is false.</i> (although a statement, it is not a proposition,
                    since it is not either true or false: if it were true, it would need to be
                    false and vice-versa).</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>

        <p>Sometimes it is debatable whether something is truly a proposition. For
            example, we generally agree that <i>Snow is white</i> is true, but someone might
            argue that they have seen black snow, so the truth value of <i>Snow is white</i> is
            put in question. Arguing about whether something is a proposition or not is
            more a matter of philosophical logic than computer science logic and we will
            therefore not be too concerned about these sort of issues.</p>
