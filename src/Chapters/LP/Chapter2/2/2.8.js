        <h1>2.8 Logical Connectives</h1>
        <p>
            The words and, or, if-then, not, only if, if-and-only-if (and other similar
            phrases) are called logical connectives, as they can be used to connect smaller
            propositions in order to obtain larger propositions.
            Pay attention! A proposition is atomic in propositional logic only if it
            cannot be decomposed into smaller propositions separated by the connectives
            discussed above. For example, the proposition every natural number is an
            integer is an atomic proposition (in propositional logic).
            The same proposition is not necessarily atomic in other logics. For exam-
            ple, in first-order logic (which we study in the second half of the semester),
            we have additional logical connectives called quantifiers that can be used
            to construct every natural number is an integer from smaller propositions.
            Therefore, every natural number is an integer is not atomic in first-order
            logic.
