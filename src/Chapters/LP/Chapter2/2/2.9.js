        <h1>2.9 Ambiguities in Natural Language</h1>
        <p>
            We have described above the language of propositional logic: atomic propo-
            sitions connected by and, or, not, etc. So far, our approach has used English.
            However, English (or any other natural language) is not suitable for our pur-
            poses because it exhibits imprecisions in the form of ambiguitites.
            Here are a few examples of ambigious propositions:
        </p>
        <br/>

        <ol>
            <li> John and Mary are married (meaning 1: John and Mary are married to
                each other; meaning 2: John and Mary are married, but not necessarily
                to each other).</li>
            <li>
             It is not true that John is tall and Jane is short (meaning 1: John is
            not tall and Jane is short; meaning 2: the conjunction John is tall and
            Jane is short is false).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br/>

        <p>
            In the study of the laws of logic, such ambiguities can get in the way, just
            like a wrong computation could impact the resistance of buildings or bridges
            in civil engineering.
            The state of the art in Logic for over 2.000 years, from Aristotle up to the
            development of Symbolic Logic in the 19th century, has been to use natural
            language. Symbolic logic (formal logic) has changed the game by introducing
            languages so precise that there is no risk of misunderstandings.
            Such ambiguities impede the study of propositional logic. Therefore we
            will design a formal language, the language of propositional logic, where no
            ambiguity can occur. The first such language that we study will be the lan-
            guage of propositional logic.
            Normally, when people say formal, they mean it in a bad way, such as
            having to dress or act formally to go to dinner.
            However, in computer science (and in mathematics), formal is a good
            thing: it means making things so precise that there is no possibility of mis-
            understanding.
