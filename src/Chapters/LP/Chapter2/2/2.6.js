        <h1>2.6 Negations</h1>
        <p>
            A proposition of the form it is not the case that φ (or simply not ψ) is the
            negation of φ. For example, It is not raining is the negation of It is raining.
            The negation of a proposition takes the opposite truth value. For example,
            as I am writing this text, the proposition It is raining is false, and therefore
            the proposition It is not raining is true.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Exercise 7.</b> Give an example of a false proposition that uses both a negation
            and a conjunction.
