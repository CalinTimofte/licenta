        <h1>2.3 Conjunctions</h1>
        <p>Others however seem to be composed of smaller parts. For example, the
            proposition <i>I play games often and I study very well</i> is composed of two
            smaller propositions: <i>I play games often</i> and <i>I study very well</i>, joined together
            by <i>and</i>. When two propositions <i>φ</i> and <i>ψ</i> are joined by an <i>and</i>, the resulting
            proposition <i>φ</i> and <i>ψ</i> is called a conjunction (<i>the conjunction of φ and ψ</i>).
            The propositions <i>φ</i> and <i>ψ</i> are called the <i>conjuncts</i> of the proposition <i>φ</i> and
            <i>ψ</i>.
            A conjunction is true if both of its conjuncts are true. For example, the
            proposition <i>I play games often and I study very well.</i> is true if both <i>I play
            games often</i> and <i>I study very well</i> are true. In particular, as I do not play
            games often, this proposition is false (when I say it).</p>

        <p>
        Note that a conjunction need not use explicitly the word and. For ex-
        ample, the proposition <i>It is raining outside, but I have an umbrella</i> is also a
        conjunction, and it conjuncts are <i>It is raining outside</i> and <i>I have an umbrella</i>.
        This particular conjunction uses the adversative conjunction <i>but</i>.
