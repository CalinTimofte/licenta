        <h1>2.4 Disjunctions</h1>
        <p>
            <i>Disjunctions</i> are propositions linked together by <i>or</i>. For example, <i>I can install
            the software on my smartphone or on my tablet</i> is a disjunction between <i>I can
            install the software on my smartphone</i> and <i>I can install the software on my
            tablet.</i>. The two parts of the disjunction are called the <i>disjuncts</i>.
            In the example above, note that the English grammar allows us to omit
            <i>I can install the software</i> . . . in the second disjunct, as it is implicit in our
            understanding of the language. However, when we find the disjuncts, is helps
            to state them explicitly.

            <b>Exercise 3.</b> <i>Find the disjuncts of</i> I will buy a laptop or a tablet. <i>Pay
            attention! The two disjuncts must be propositions (some words in them could
            be implicit and not appear in the text)</i>.
        </p>

            A disjunction is true if at least one of the disjuncts is true. For example,
            <i>I am Darth Vader or I teach</i> is true because <i>I teach</i> is true (I do not have to
            worry about being Darth Vader). <i>I teach or I program</i> is also true (it happens
            that both disjuncts are true).
            This meaning of disjunctions is called the <i>inclusive or</i>. It is standard in
            mathematics. Sometimes people use <i>or</i> in natural language to mean <i>exclusive
            or</i>. For example <i>Either white wins or black wins in a game of go</i> is an example
            where the <i>or</i> is exclusive. The meaning of the sentence is that <i>white wins</i> or
            <i>black wins</i>, but not both. Here is an example of a false proposition that uses
            <i>exclusive or</i> : <i>Either I program or I teach</i> (hint: false because I do both).
            When you see <i>either</i> in a sentence, it is a sign that you are dealing with an
            <i>exclusive or</i>.
            In the following, by <i>disjunction</i> we will understand <i>inclusive or</i> (the stan-
            dard interpretation in mathematics).

        <p><b>Exercise 4.</b><i>Give an example of a false disjunction and an example of a true
            disjunction.</i></p>
        <br />

        <p><b>Exercise 5.</b><i>When is a disjunction φ or ψ false (depending on the truth value
            of φ and ψ)?</i></p>
